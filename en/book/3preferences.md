*View of the Preferences*

**Item 1:** The question of screen you have a navigation bar that allows you to navigate between the different test questions by marking those that the student has answered. How many items will appear in this list before breaking the line is set in this item. This allows you to use the leveling at any resolution.

**Item 2:** The editor of the documents can be either a simple editor and can be an elaborate editor that allows you to enter even youtube videos. I recommend using the koivi editor because this is recommended by xoops.org team, but I also suggest to test the mastop_publish that will attached inside the Extras folder to have more features and be done by a Brazilian (topet05)

**Item 3:** When the student termianr of to prove he can either have to wait for a green signal from the teacher stating that the result is out, as it may have the result immediately. Everything will depend on your business case. Sometimes it is interesting that the students only know of your note in a specific later date, other times it is he needs to know immediately. Let's see what is emlhor in your case.

**Item 4:** In the administration there are several lists that display questions documents evidence and results. Here you set how many items are displayed per page. I recommend the use of 5 same, no regret for the server.

**Item 5:** This is known of XOOPS users. Here you define whether or not that students can choose to be notified of the results of his test came out.

**Item 6:** It is also known to xoopers. In this configuration item you choose which events are enabled. In the case of our module for now only an event there so it does not make much sense, but who knows in the next version.
